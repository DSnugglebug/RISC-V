# RISC-V

In this project I described a RISC-based processor architecture focusing on its micro-architecture and individual components. Using the guide provided by a copyrighted documentation from Maven Silicon. It serves as a guide for understanding the system's operation, its signal flow, and its modular design. 

**Micro-Archicture component include**
  Program Counter (PC)
  Register Files
  Immediate Generators
  Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
  Control Units
  Load and Store Units


  **DataFlow**
  Three stage pipeline.
  Signal encoding for various instruction types.
  Handling of branches, jumps, and exceptions.
